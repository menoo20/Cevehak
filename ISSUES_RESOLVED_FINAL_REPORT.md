## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Issues Fixed:** 2/2  
**User Confirmation:** ✅ Verified working

---

## 📋 RESOLVED ISSUES

### ✅ Issue #1: 404 Error on Image Gallery
**Problem:** Images were not accessible when clicked in the admin panel attachment gallery  
**Root Cause:** File path inconsistencies between database and file system  
**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed file path storage in database to match actual file locations
- Corrected CVSubmission model to include service_type in INSERT statements
- Updated existing submissions with correct file paths
- Verified HTTP 200 responses for all image URLs

**Files Modified:**
- `models/CVSubmission.js` - Added service_type to INSERT query
- Database records - Corrected file paths for existing submissions

### ✅ Issue #2: Multiple Folders Per Client
**Problem:** System created numbered folders (Mohammed_amin/, Mohammed_amin_1/, etc.) instead of reusing existing folders  
**Root Cause:** `createUserFolder()` function always created new numbered variants  
**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `createUserFolder()` function to check for existing folders first
- Implemented folder reuse logic instead of creating numbered variants
- Consolidated existing files into single client folder
- Verified single folder structure maintained

**Files Modified:**
- `middleware/flexibleUpload.js` - Fixed createUserFolder logic

## 🔧 KEY CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### Database Model Fix
```javascript
// Added service_type to destructuring and INSERT query
const { ..., service_type, ... } = submissionData;
// INSERT statement now includes service_type parameter
```

### Upload Middleware Enhancement
```javascript
const createUserFolder = (userIdentifier) => {
    const userFolder = path.join(uploadDir, userIdentifier);
    
    // ✅ NEW: Reuse existing folder instead of creating numbered variants
    if (!fs.existsSync(userFolder)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(userFolder, { recursive: true });
        console.log(`📁 Created new folder: ${userIdentifier}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`📁 Reusing existing folder: ${userIdentifier}`);
    }
    return userFolder;
};
```
